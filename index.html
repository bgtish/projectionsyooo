    <h1>Homework 3: Experimenting with Projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h2>
    <p>For this project, I modified vector data downloaded from Natural Earth of a world map. After I unzipped the file, I was able to 
        import the same base shapefile into QGIS for each of my projections. Then, I changed the CRS, or Coordinate Reference
        System, that the map was being projected with. To do this, I inputted the specified ESRI or EPSG projection identifications (think "EPSG:3857" for the 
        Pseudo-Mercator projection). From there, I applied the Indicatrix Mapper plugin to my project which put a layer of ellipsoidal caps over
        my map to visualize the inherent distortions caused by that certain projection. Finally, I fit my map into the print layout and exported it as a PNG. I 
        repeated this process for all projections.  </p>
    

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is widely used as the standard for GPS. Although it is nearly perfect at the equator,
        there is major area, distance, and shape distortion occurs at the poles. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has the most correct scale along the central meridian and equator.
        It also has value in being an ellipsoidal shape, which is reminiscent of 
        the original spherical shape of the earth. However, the peripheral regions of the map have
        the most distortion, of direction, distance, area and shape.

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection: EPSG-3857</h2>
    <h3>Although this projection preserves shapes and especially direction, 
        it greatly distorts area and distance! This is evidenced by the Atlantic Ocean looking much smaller 
        and land masses near the poles, such as Antarctica and Greenland looking gigantic 
        in juxtaposition to other continents.

    <h2>Winkel Projection: ESRI-53018</h2>
    <h3>This Azimuthal projection noticeably distorts distances, area, and 
        size at the poles. At higher latitudes, landmasses are closer together, 
        longer, and bigger than they should be. However, this projection has 
        much less distortion of the poles than Mercator or Pseudo-Mercator projections.

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection: ESRI-54034
    </h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves the relative area of polygons (oceans, 
        continents, islands, etc.) but it does so at great cost to the shape 
        of these features. The Northern Hemisphere in particular looks very squashed.

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection: ESRI-54027
    </h2>
    <h3> In this projection, which has a view above the North Pole, distance 
        is accurate anywhere on the map. The least distortion is near the center, 
        but the most southern regions of the map suffer from extreme area and 
        shape distortion. Additionally, the projectionâ€™s design greatly 
        enlarges the Pacific Ocean on first glance.

    <h2>Azimuthal Equidistant Projection: ESRI-102016</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the above conic projection, this projection is a highly accurate 
        portrait of distance. However it has slightly more dramatic area and 
        shape distortion at the map's periphery. It is famously seen on the UN logo.

    <h2>US Atlas Equal Area Projection: EPSG-2163
    </h2>
    <h3> This projection is specifically intended to retain the exact area of the United States, 
        but for the most part it also limits area and shape distortion in nearby areas such as South 
        America and the North Pole. The visible areas furthest from America, such as South Asia and Antarctica are substantially distorted in shape and size enough for this map to be inappropriate to use in a global view.

    <h2>Robinson Projection: ESRI-54030
    </h2>
    <h3> The Robinson Projection is one of the strongest projections for displaying 
        the whole world, because although direction, distance, shape, and size are distorted at high latitude, such changes are minimal.
