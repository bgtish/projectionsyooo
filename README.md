<p>
      Hello! My name is Bettye Tish, the creator of this site and video. I am currently a freshman at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and majoring in Environmental Studies. I am taking MEJO 121 as a prerequisite for the Environmental Science Communications Dual Degree Program. I hope to complete the ESC program and pursue work in law, teaching, journalism, or a non-profit. I am not sure of exactly what I want to do yet but I aspire to have a career of helping the environment and connecting with others. Previously, I went to Myers Park High School in Charlotte, North Carolina and completed the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Although I have yet to become involved with clubs at UNC, there once was a time I had too many extracurriculars to fit on CommonApp! I served MPHS as Senior Class President, President of Odyssey of the Mind, and President of Sallies Acapella, founded a club promoting transfer student inclusivity, was an active member of Speech and Debate, acted in community theater, and was a part of National Honors Society, to name a few! Needless to say, college has been a more relaxed experience, and I am focusing on myself, my friendships, and planning for my future.

  Outside of my academic life, I love to be outdoors, express myself creatively, and spend time with the people I love. Every summer since seventh grade, I have backpacked in Southwestern Virginia with Wilderness Trail Ministries. Throughout the years, I have progressed from hiker to Junior Staff, and this summer will be my first year as a full-fledged staff! I am so excited to lead groups on hiking expeditions in the Mt. Rodgers area, which is full of wild ponies, delicious blueberries and gorgeous grassy balds. Wilderness Trail also nurtures my creative side; I love making friendship bracelets, telling campfire stories and performing in weekly skits.

  At home, I dabble in various artistic hobbies: everything from embroidery to film photography to soap making. I wish I was interested in less hobbies so I might actually master some of them:) Directly after college, I hope to make traveling my primary hobby. I am saving up money to backpack Europe and road trip across America. After that, I would love to do seasonal work in a couple of the National Parks before finally settling down. Although I crave traveling, I also deeply appreciate time at home. Nothing relaxes me more than watching my favorite shows on the couch with my dad, particularly Community and Arrested Development. I am very close with my parents and younger brother;  I wish I could say the same about our two cats! Scout and Maeve are mostly indifferent to me and my overbearing affection. Maybe that is because my friends describe me as the human embodiment of a Golden Retrieverâ€¦ I am a very energetic, expressive, and friendly person.
